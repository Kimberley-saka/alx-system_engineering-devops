FIREWALLS
- A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. 
- Here we set up UFW (Uncomplicate Firewall).
- UFW is a simplified firewall management interface that hides the complexity of lower-level packet filtering technologies such as iptables and nftables.
